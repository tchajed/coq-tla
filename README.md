# TLA in Coq

[![CI](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-tla/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-tla/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Embedding TLA in Coq (actually more like LTL). The goal is to better understand
how TLA can be used for liveness reasoning especially, by playing around with
the proof system and trying out small examples with full proofs (even if they
are painful and overly tedious).
